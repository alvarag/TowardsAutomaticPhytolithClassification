# Towards automatic phytolith classification using feature extraction and combination strategies

This repository presents a comparative analysis of the use of different types of sets of features, combination of features, and combination of classifiers (through Stacking) for automatic phytolith classification, including the novel vision transformers that have shown a remarkable performance in different areas, including computer vision.
In this research, twenty-two different sets of features (three based on shape, sixteen on appearance, and three on texture) and six classifiers (alone and combined via stacking strategies) were compared.
